# Monitoring Phase

Continuously observe model and system behavior in production, detect issues, and maintain performance over time.

## Contents

- [Performance Metrics](./performance-metrics.md) - Track key metrics
- [Drift Detection](./drift-detection.md) - Identify data/model drift
- [Retraining Strategy](./retraining-strategy.md) - Plan model updates
- [Incident Response](./incident-response.md) - Handle production issues

## Purpose

The Monitoring phase ensures:
- **Continuous Observation** - Real-time system monitoring
- **Early Detection** - Identify issues before they impact users
- **Performance Tracking** - Measure against SLAs
- **Drift Detection** - Catch data/model distribution changes
- **Proactive Response** - Automated or quick manual intervention

## Key Activities

1. **Metric Collection** - Gather performance and system data
2. **Alerting** - Notify teams of anomalies
3. **Analysis** - Investigate performance changes
4. **Retraining** - Update models when needed
5. **Documentation** - Record issues and resolutions

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All metrics collected and visible
- [ ] Alerting system responsive
- [ ] Drift detected early
- [ ] Incidents resolved quickly
- [ ] Retraining procedures effective
- [ ] Root causes documented

## Key Dashboards

- Real-time system health
- Model performance trends
- Data quality metrics
- Incident tracking
- Alert history

## Next Steps
