Step 3: [Current challenges]
```

### Current Metrics & Performance
- **Accuracy:** [Current accuracy/manual error rate]
- **Speed:** [Current processing time]
- **Cost:** [Current operational cost]
- **Volume:** [Current volume handled]
- **Quality:** [Current quality metrics]

### Bottlenecks & Limitations
1. **Bottleneck 1:** [Description and impact]
2. **Bottleneck 2:** [Description and impact]
3. **Bottleneck 3:** [Description and impact]

## 4. Desired Future State

### To-Be Process
```
Step 1: [Desired future state]
Step 2: [ML model integration]
Step 3: [Expected benefits]
```

### Target Metrics & Performance
- **Accuracy:** [Target accuracy]
- **Speed:** [Target processing time]
- **Cost:** [Target cost]
- **Volume:** [Target volume capability]
- **Quality:** [Target quality metrics]

### Improvement Targets

| Metric | Current | Target | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Accuracy | | | |
| Processing Time | | | |
| Cost per Transaction | | | |
| User Satisfaction | | | |

## 5. Business Value & ROI

### Financial Impact
- **Cost Reduction:** [Annual savings]
- **Revenue Increase:** [New revenue opportunities]
- **Efficiency Gains:** [Time/resource savings]
- **Risk Mitigation:** [Avoided costs]

### Intangible Benefits
- Improved customer satisfaction
- Reduced employee burnout
- Better decision-making
- Competitive advantage
- Risk mitigation
- Scalability

### ROI Calculation
```
Benefits (Annual):
  Cost Savings: $X
  Revenue Increase: $Y
  Risk Mitigation: $Z
  Total Benefits: $X+Y+Z

Costs (First Year):
  Development: $A
  Infrastructure: $B
  Training: $C
  Operations: $D
  Total Costs: $A+B+C+D

ROI = (Benefits - Costs) / Costs
Payback Period = Investment / Annual Benefits
```

## 6. Stakeholder Requirements

### User Requirements
- **Primary Users:** [Who uses the model?]
- **User Needs:** [What do users need?]
- **User Constraints:** [What limits user acceptance?]
- **Usability Requirements:** [How easy must it be to use?]

### Business Requirements
- **Availability:** [System uptime requirement]
- **Performance:** [Speed requirements]
- **Scalability:** [Volume requirements]
- **Reliability:** [Failure tolerance]
- **Security:** [Data protection needs]
- **Compliance:** [Regulatory requirements]

## 7. Constraints & Dependencies

### Technical Constraints
- **System Integration:** [What systems must we integrate with?]
- **Data Availability:** [What data is available?]
- **Computing Resources:** [What infrastructure is available?]
- **Technology Stack:** [Approved technologies]

### Organizational Constraints
- **Budget Limit:** [Maximum budget]
- **Timeline:** [Deadline]
- **Team Size:** [Available resources]
- **Skills:** [Available expertise]

### External Dependencies
- **Data Provider Dependencies:** [Who provides data?]
- **System Dependencies:** [What systems must we depend on?]
- **Vendor Dependencies:** [Vendor support needed?]

## 8. Success Factors

### Critical Success Factors
1. **CSF 1:** [What is critical to success?]
2. **CSF 2:** [What else is critical?]
3. **CSF 3:** [Another critical factor]

### Assumptions
1. **Assumption 1:** [What must be true?]
2. **Assumption 2:** [What else must be true?]

### Risk Factors
1. **Risk 1:** [What could go wrong?]
2. **Risk 2:** [Other risks?]

## 9. Alternatives Analysis

### Option 1: Build In-House ML Model
**Pros:** Full control, customized
**Cons:** Time, expertise, cost
**Effort:** High | **Timeline:** 6-12 months | **Cost:** $$$

### Option 2: Implement Third-Party Solution
**Pros:** Fast deployment, proven solution
**Cons:** Limited customization, licensing cost
**Effort:** Low | **Timeline:** 1-3 months | **Cost:** $$

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
